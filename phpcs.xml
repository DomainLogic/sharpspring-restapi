            I make an effort to keep lines under 120 characters, except:
            - function declarations, which I don't split into multiple lines
            - exceptions thrown, where I don't split the message into a
              variable just to keep the line length OK.
            I might change my mind one day but I don't think that improves
            readability, and I don't think a line length check is very
            necessary in general, as long as we can keep the 'real code'
            adhering to a rough standard.

            their own separate directory/namespace yet). We have to use
            underscores because non-underscore properties are all 'real' values
            in the object.
